**First verion of NXSC is not published yet! I created this README and wiki, because I want you to saw capability of this script and how to use it in the future.**

NXSC is a Python script for easy download, install and update software on Microsoft Windows operating systems  
This script is similar to `apt-get` or `aptitude` in Debian/Ubuntu.

NXSC uses [FileHippo.com](http://filehippo.com/) to search and install software.  
Custom repositories will be available in future versions.  

**List of all functions (links lead to the corresponding page on the wiki):**
- search
- install (for now without unattended installation)
- upgrade
- display additional information about package

**Requirements for using pure Python script:**
- [Python](http://python.org/) 3.3
- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/)

**How to run:**  
Shabang is set to `#!python3` so you don't need to add `python` or `python3` before `nxsc.py ...`.
